- 👋 Hi, I’m @vmmoret. You can call me Vitoria.
- 👀 I’m interested in knowing more about this which to me might seem an amazing virtual community and platform. I'm yet not a coder, but a designer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding on mimo (the app).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on product research, customer insight and project management, and the relationship among these with coding and digital development.
- 📫 How to reach me: ADPList for mentorship (https://adplist.org/mentors/vitoria-mortari-moret), LinkedIn for connections (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitoriamoret), Twitter for discussions (https://twitter.com/prjctvivi), Pinterest for inspiration (https://www.pinterest.se/vmmoret), or my portfolio (http://vmort.me).
